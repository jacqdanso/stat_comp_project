# Analyzing Public Comments to the FCC on Net Neutrality Using Agglomerative Clustering and Text Identifier Classification
### Jacqueline Antwi-Danso and Tarini Konchady

Our project report is located in the repository as a PDF. You can find all the notebooks we used for the analysis here as well. We would not have been able to do this without Jeff Kao's [https://github.com/j2kao/fcc_nn_research](publically available repository) (and his excellent [https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6](post) that got us interested in the FCC data in the first place).
